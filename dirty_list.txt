In no particular order:

Error variance for sensor

Error variance for satellite

Error Covariances for satellite

Non-gaussian error for both

** .resample vs sp.interpolate for sensor data

H for sensors does not include fact that sensors are time average and sat are
space average

Better means of removing background

Ensemble creation
         Shift CI map (by different h, by simple shifting,
         by using wind field (like shifts in time))

         What variances should be used for: wind, CI field, height

         Should CI field perturbation be constant over the whole domain or
         some smooth field over the whole domain?
